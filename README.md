# Scold Or Troll

This app is a simple wrap of the twitter API for python. Provided with a blacklist file, in which twitter usernames are entered without the @ sign and in separate lines, the program is able to find whether or not a particular person follows anyone in that particular list, allowing to somewhat automate the process of finding out if a person might be acting in bad faith.

## Running the source

To run from the source, you need the `twitter` and `PyQt5` modules installed in python, use `pip` to install those, then simply run `python3 main.py` to run the program.
